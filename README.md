# RECIPE SHARING APP

This is my final project for BGIT bootcamp. This website is a food recipe sharing website.

## About The Website

A recipe website is an online platform that provides a collection of culinary instructions and ideas for preparing various dishes. It typically includes recipes categorized by type, cuisine, ingredients, or dietary preferences.

# Technologies Used

The programing language I used in building this website are HTML, CSS, Javascript and Bootstrap.

# Reson behind building the website

The primary reason I chose to build a recipe website is to provide a valuable resource for food enthusiasts, home cooks, and anyone seeking culinary inspiration. This website offer a convenient way to access a wide range of recipes from different cuisines and dietary preferences, making it easier for people to explore new dishes and expand their cooking skills. The websites also allow users to search for specific recipes and often provide helpful tips and techniques to enhance the cooking experience

# API DOCUMENTATION

The API used in this website is the MealDB API. The MealDB API is a powerful tool that offers developers access to a comprehensive database of recipes, ingredients, and culinary information. Its primary role is to enhance a website's functionality by providing a wide range of food-related content.

By integrating the MealDB API into this website, I was able incorporate features such as recipe search, ingredient lookup, and recipe recommendations. This enables users to easily find specific recipes, explore new dishes, and cater to their dietary preferences or restrictions.

The MealDB API provides detailed recipe information including ingredients, instructions, images, nutritional facts, and even video tutorials. This wealth of data allows websites to offer comprehensive cooking resources to their users, helping them make informed decisions and create delicious meals.

# CHALLENGES FACED

During the course of building this website, lot of challenges arose. Some of the challenges I faced are listed below:

- [ ] Content Management
- [ ] User Interface and Experience
- [ ] Data Organization
- [ ] Integration with External APIs

## Content Management

The first challenge that came my way was content management. Curating and managing a large database of recipes can be time-consuming and requires careful attention to detail. Ensuring the accuracy, consistency, and quality of recipe content can be challenging, especially when dealing with user-submitted recipes or integrating data from external sources.

## User Interface and Experience

I also faced some challenges while designing the website. Designing an intuitive and user-friendly interface that allows visitors to easily search, navigate, and interact with recipes can be a complex task. Balancing aesthetics with functionality and providing a seamless user experience across different devices and browsers is crucial. I was able to over-come this challenge by making lot of research which helped me generate ideas.

## Data Organization

Recipes often have multiple components such as ingredients, instructions, cooking times, and nutritional information. Organizing this data in a structured and standardized format was really challenging for me, but I plan on working more on the website in the future.

## Integration with External APIs

While I was trying to integrate with external APIs like the MealDB API, I faced some challenges in terms of handling API requests, managing API keys, and ensuring seamless integration with the website's features. But I was able to overcome this challenge by consuming adequate resources such as youtube videos.
